### Takeaways
- The application is currently hosted on an EC2 Instance that can be accessed at [https://ec2-18-189-186-8.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/](https://ec2-18-117-71-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/)

- I personally have had next to no experince in the initial setup of EC2 infrastructure. I believe I managed to configure the instance properly and while it is currently secured with a self-signed certificate, I will secure it with a public certificate once Amazon verifies things. I had also wished to integrate GitLab and it's CI/CD pipelines and while I was able to ensure that the pipeline was able to build and test that the server functioned properly, I was not able to find a solution as to transfering the files to an ec2 instance due to the limited security policies of free AWS accounts. I plan on searching for more solutions and will update the project if one is found.
